## Agricultural Overview
- 37% of economic output in 2021
- 80% of exports
- 37.64% of GDP in 2022
## Land Overview
- 38.5mill hectares of agricultural land in Ethiopia
	- 16mill arable (14.5% of total land)
		- 96% in small scale farmers
			- 57% hold 0.96 to 1.2 hectares
		- 4% State and Producers Cooperatives
	- 20mill permanent pastures
## Yield Overview
- PM plans for 80mill tons of grain in 2023/24
- 2023/24 wheat production down by 5% from previous years
	- Despite higher trends across 10 years
- 2022 wheat yield:
	- 3.0435 tons per hectare
		- Up from 1.3874 tons per hectare from 2003
- Crop yields against water-limited potentials
	- Wheat: 26.8%
	- Maize: 19.7%
	- Sorghum: 29.3%
	- Common Bean: 35.5%

## Current Situation
- Since 1950, crop varieties released
	- 501 cereal
	- 277 grain legumes
- According to [YieldGap.org](https://yieldgap.org) [tonnes/hectare]
	- Wheat (2005-2017) - 26.8%
		- Yield Potential: 9.6
		- Water -limited Yield Potential: 8.3
		- Actual Yield: 2.2
	- Common Bean (2003-2012) - 35.5%
		- Yield Potential: 3.4
		- Water -limited Yield Potential: 3.4
		- Actual Yield: 1.2
- Fertilizer and Variety crops Utilization
	- Wheat
		- Improved variety: 43%
		- N: 91%
		- P2O5: 63%
		- N + P2O5: 176%
	- Common Bean
		- Improved variety: 80%
		- N: 68%
		- P2O5: 60%
		- N + P2O5: 107%
## Limitations
- Preference for farmer selected variety
- Low adoption of newer, better tech
	- Production
		- modern methods
		- modern vareity
- governing traits for farmer choice
	- Wheat
		- Disease resistance
		- Drought resistance
		- Earliness
	- Common Bean
		- Seed size
		- Earliness
		- Drought resistance
		- Disease resistant

## Benefits
- Use of fertilizers showed trends of 2-3 fold yield
- Improved variety crops showed 24 - 160% increase in yield 
- More than just improved yield
	- Data about land state:
		- Fertility
		- Age
		- Productivity of soil 
	- Utilization of land without needing to add more land to capacity

## Implementation
### Overview
- IoT based data collection and aggregation
	- multiple sensor array feeds
	- geo-location and geo-fenced data
- Data aggregation to feed model design, training and refinement
- Model to practical implementation
- Review and Refine

### Specifics
- IoT cluster design and deployment
	- Sensor arrays
	- Relays
	- Geo-fenced location
- Drone and human fed point data
- Control and normal agricultural sites
	- Control will be the ideal or lab scenario
		- Designated soil mineral, pH levels, salinity and more
	- Normal fields will be the natural implementation of improved methods by regular farmers
- Model Design, Training and Refining
	- Design an ideal model structure
		- Model frame
		- Data structure
		- Data input and output pipeline framework
		- Training capacity requirements and preparations
	- Training model
		- Initiate data pipeline to aggregate data towards a cleaner
		- Initialize training
		- Data  Quality Control
	- Refining model
		- Check final output against design and requirements
		- Retrain or Refine as needed
- Test data output from model on control fields
- Implement data output from model on Normal farm fields
- Review and Refine

## AIMS
- Maximum utilization of land, water and human resources
- Elevate human living standards among farmers
	- By extension others in related fields of work
- Building basis for a partially or fully automated agricultural work
	- production
	- processing
	- distribution
	- governance
- Build basis 
	- for 
		- interconnected
		- centralized 
	- systems for 
		- production
		- harvest
		- and consumption
- Extend land lifespan and productivity
- Effective utilization of resources leading to lessened demand for more land to cultivate 
	- Will lead to more land going to industrialization, manufacturing and natural preserves
